              These are "Water Pens" which use water to dye a canvas. The water is supposed to by symbolic of sweat in

            <h5>
              There is a servo at the bottom which would hold different colours which the pen could absorb on the bottom
              of its range and then paint as its arms rise. These colours would represent the difficult of the rep. Once
              a specific range is reached, it would change colour.

      <h4>I did not account for the change in weight distribution and how adding things to the arms would change the
        requirements of the support structure (popsicle sticks behind the wooden figure)</h4>
      <h4>I had and tried many ideas such as adding string support and rubber bands however, they both had their own
        issues and were ineffective </h4>

      <h4>Additionally, water pens did not seem to be a good fit as they often required being squeezed in order to
        actually make a mark on the canvas which would not work for this use case.</h4>
