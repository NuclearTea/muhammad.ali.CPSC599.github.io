      <h1>Description</h1>
      <p>
        The hope with this musical instrument was to channel the experience of
        your childhood (or even adulthood) in swinging a lightsabre along with
        gripping it various ways to produce music, allowing the user to not only
        make sounds using the capacitive touch sensor (which is where I got
        stuck) but also the movement of the entire hilt to create, and enhance
        the sounds produced
      </p>

        I had a couple of ideas in the duration of this project. Below, I will
        share some images and quick descriptions of them. I went with sketching
        as my primary mode of exploration as I am currently taking another class
        (CPSC 581, Human Computer Interaction 2) where this is a focus and I
        thought that it would be a way to get some ideas out
      </p>
      <ul>
        <h3>
          Here are some initial ideas I had. They display some of the different
          ideas I was toying with, some of which I prototyped, and tried to
          implement in other ideas

              A box which had sensors around (photoresistors) and a sonar sensor
              in the back (which could detect distance) and puncing in different
              areas of the box would create a different sound. Punching closer
              to the back (near to the sonar sensor) would change the pitch. An
              attempt at using our various degrees of freedom along with depth
              perception to create music. Also, a potential fun workout.

              A pencil with capacitive touch sensors which would map to a
              kalimba. It would be a bit more versatile as you could also tap

              A PVC Pipe lined with Copper wire with an aluminium foil surface

            <p>
              A light would eminate from the PVC (like the lightsabre) which

              A sound sensor would detect the movement of the PVC (via airflow
