        <h4>We were tasked to find/create a dataset that represents something about yourself. </h4>
        <h4>Then, we must represent this data (or the change in the data) using actuation (servos, stepper motors) which
            often, would involve mechanical systems like:
            <ul>
                <li>Rack & Pinion</li>
                <li>Slider Crank</li>

            ever since.</h4>
        <h4>Training also includes tracking my workouts (exercises, sets, reps, rpe, and my general feelings during the
            sessions), done mainly in physical notebooks originally, and now, in spreadsheets.</h4>

            controlling it like a puppet. This resulted in versions like the following.</h3>

        <h3>One of the major issues I recognized early on and is extremely apparent with the above approaches is that
            the servos themselves are moving, and so the surface they are mounted to also must allow them to move. </h3>
        <h4>This was a difficult problem to solve, however, I believe I found a good solution which you will see below.

        <h3>I realized that the servos exert equal forces (for the most part) in perpendicular directions, if I mount
            them to the slider crank (which will allow them to move independently), their own forces will cancel out and
            stay mounted to the figure</h3>
